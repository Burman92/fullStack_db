FullStack_db

## Description
This is a FullStack database that uses the backend that I created, the backend holds the ninja's name, signature move, and village that they were last seen at. The village will be generated randomly. On the front end the user will input a number between then options dipslayed on the search box and the information from the backend will be requested to the front end and displayed to the user.
